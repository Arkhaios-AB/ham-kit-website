        <h1>Product Ideas</h1>
<p>These are concepts I'm currently researching and evaluating. If you're interested in any of these projects or have feedback, I'd love to hear from you.</p>
<h3>Hybrid LFP battery power supply</h3>
<p>A power supply that combines a low-power switching or linear supply with an LFP (Lithium Iron Phosphate) battery for handling high-power transmission peaks. The key insight: most amateur radio operation involves more listening than transmitting.</p>
<p>During receive periods (low power draw), the supply charges the LFP battery at a modest rate. When transmitting (high power demand), the battery supplements the supply to deliver the required current. This allows for:</p>
<ul>
<li>A smaller, cheaper primary power supply</li>
<li>Battery provides instantaneous high current without voltage drop</li>
<li>Natural load leveling over the duty cycle</li>
<li>Low noise operation</li>
</ul>
<h3>Design Challenges</h3>
<p>The viability depends on calculating:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Expected duty cycle</strong>: Typical listen/transmit ratio for various operating modes (SSB, CW, digital modes, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Charge rate requirements</strong>: How fast the battery needs to recharge between transmissions</li>
<li><strong>Battery capacity</strong>: Minimum capacity to handle transmission bursts without excessive depth of discharge</li>
<li><strong>Charge efficiency</strong>: LFP cells are efficient but not 100% - losses need to be factored in</li>
<li><strong>Overall running cost</strong>: LFP batteres are not cheap and the charge/discharge efficiency is 95%.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Potential Benefits</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reduced power consumption during standby/receive</li>
<li>Smaller, quieter power supply (no need to size for peak transmit current)</li>
<li>Battery can provide backup power during brief mains interruptions</li>
<li>Could be more cost-effective than a full 40A+ power supply (??)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Open Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>What duty cycles are realistic for different operating modes?</li>
<li>Optimal battery chemistry and cell configuration?</li>
<li>Linear or SMPS for the charging supply?</li>
<li>Battery management and balancing requirements?</li>
<li>Integration with existing transceivers?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Regenerative DC Electronic Load</h2>
<p>Testing power supplies requires dummy loads that convert electrical energy into heat. For high-power testing (20-40A at 13.8V = 275-550W), this becomes wasteful and requires substantial cooling. A typical session could waste several kWh.</p>
<p>A regenerative DC electronic load that converts the DC test current back to AC and feeds it into the mains grid, recovering 95%+ of the energy that would otherwise be wasted as heat.</p>
<h3>Key Features</h3>
<p><strong>Energy Recovery:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Active rectification/inversion to feed energy back to grid</li>
<li>Target efficiency: 95%+ (only 5% becomes heat vs. 100% in resistive loads)</li>
<li>Significant cost savings over time for frequent testing</li>
<li>Reduced cooling requirements</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Functionality:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Programmable constant current, constant voltage, constant power, and constant resistance modes</li>
<li>Wide current range: 0-40A (to match power supply testing needs)</li>
<li>Voltage range: 0-15V (covers 13.8V nominal with margin)</li>
<li>Current regulation accuracy and stability</li>
<li>Protection: over-voltage, over-current, over-temperature</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>User Interface:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Digital display for voltage, current, power readings</li>
<li>Adjustable setpoints via rotary encoder or digital controls</li>
<li>Real-time power and energy measurements</li>
<li>Data logging capabilities</li>
</ul>
<h3>Use Cases</h3>
<ul>
<li>Power supply development and testing</li>
<li>Quality control and burn-in testing</li>
<li>Battery charger testing</li>
<li>Educational tool for power electronics</li>
</ul>
