# About

Hello, I'm Nicolas Herment. Artisan HAM Kits is a side project I run from my office during evenings and weekends as a one-man operation.

## My Background

My journey into electronics began with a background in microelectronics, where I developed a deep understanding of electronic components and circuit design. My professional career has been spent as a software engineer, which gives me a unique perspective on both hardware and software aspects of building and documenting projects.

## How This Started

Artisan HAM Kits came to life from a simple frustration: I was looking for power supply kits I could assemble myself for my amateur radio station. The choice was either buying commercial units made in the far east or spending countless hours chasing down individual components from existing open designs scattered across various suppliers.

I wanted something in between: a curated kit with all the right components, ready to build, with good documentation. When I couldn't find it, I decided to create it myself.

However I'm now spending even more countless hours chasing down components and testing designs...

## The Approach

Every kit is carefully prepared by me in Sweden, ensuring quality component selection and proper documentation. The kits are built on proven, open-source designs from respected engineers in the amateur radio community.

- **Open Designs:** All designs are open-sourced. It's my intention to make it easy for you to purchase components yourself directly from local distributors if you prefer. The kits are simply a convenience, not a requirement.
- **Quality Selection:** I carefully select components to ensure reliable operation.
- **Builder-Friendly:** Whether you want a complete disassembled kit for the full building experience, a partially assembled unit, or buy the components yourself, pick the option you prefer.
- **Clear Documentation:** Each kit comes with comprehensive documentation and support.
- **Local providers** I try to source as many components as possible from European manufacturers. This is not easy. For example most passive components are not from Europe. This is something I'm constantly looking to improve.

## Philosophy

I believe that understanding your equipment makes you a better operator. By building your own power supply, you gain insights into its operation, become better equipped to troubleshoot issues, and get the satisfaction of using equipment you've crafted with your own hands.

The amateur radio community has always been about experimentation, learning, and sharing knowledge. This project is my contribution to that tradition.

## Legal

Artisan HAM Kits is operated by Arkhaios AB, a Swedish company of which I'm the owner. This is how the kits are formally sold and shipped.

## Get in Touch

Whether you have questions about the kits, need technical support, or just want to share your build experience, I'd love to hear from you.
