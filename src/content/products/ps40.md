# PSS-V138-40 - 13.8V/40A Switching Power Supply

<div class="notice">
    <strong>Development Status:</strong> This kit is currently under development and expected to be available in Q1 2027.
</div>

The PSS-V138-40 is a high-efficiency switching power supply designed for modern amateur radio stations requiring substantial current capacity in a compact footprint. Based on the proven design from [Ludens.cl](https://ludens.cl/Electron/PS40/PS40.html), this SMPS delivers impressive performance with intelligent features.

## Advanced Features

### Intelligent Cooling System

The PSS-V138-40 features a smart cooling fan that operates based on the average current drawn. This ensures efficient cooling when needed while maintaining quiet operation during light loads.

### RF Noise Minimization

Unlike many switching supplies, the PSS-V138-40 produces no detectable RF noise at any frequency higher than the main switching frequency of 50kHz. This is achieved through careful component selection, using bipolar transistors with proportional drive techniques rather than MOSFETs.

### Visual Voltage Monitoring

A tricolor LED provides instant feedback on output voltage status:

- **Green:** Normal operation (13.8V nominal)
- **Orange:** Low voltage warning
- **Red:** High voltage alert

### Flexible Operation

- No minimum load requirement
- Current limiting capability
- Compatible with direct 12V battery connection
- Pulse-width modulation control via IC 3524 for stable regulation

## Compact and Efficient Design

The half bridge forward converter topology delivers high power density, making this supply significantly more compact than equivalent linear designs. At 88% efficiency, the PSS-V138-40 generates less waste heat and reduces operating costs.

## Ideal Applications

- High-power HF transceivers (100W and above)
- VHF/UHF mobile and base stations
- Contest and DXpedition stations requiring high current
- Multi-radio setups and portable operations
- Installations where space and weight are constrained

## What's Included

The PSS-V138-40 kit includes all necessary components, PCB, transformer, heatsink, cooling fan, and comprehensive assembly documentation. Available in both complete disassembled form or partially assembled configurations to suit your building preferences.
